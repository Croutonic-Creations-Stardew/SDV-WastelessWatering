# SDV-WastelessWatering
Makes it so you are extremely careful with your watering can, so you never waste any water.  For an downloads and further documentation, go to A4A Mods

## Use

Any time you try to use a watering can, WastelessWatering will attempt to determine if the place you are trying to water is worthy. However, it can be wrong, so you do have the ability to temporarily disable it using one of the following modes to teach it whose boss.

### Default | Toggle Mode

By default, the mod is in Toggle Mode. This means if you press the ToggleKey (default `shift + ,`), WastelessWatering will be completely disabled until you press it again.

### Hold Mode

If you enable this mode, WastelessWatering will always be active, unless you are activly holding the Toggle Key down.
